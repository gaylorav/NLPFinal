# NLPFinal

## Code

All code for the models can be found in .ipynb files. Original files use three classes, 
while files ending with V2 use a modified dataset with only two classes. Code ending with .py or .R were used
for data cleaning or exploration and their output is stored in the other files. To run the models,
open them in Google CoLab and select "Run All." This will download all prerequistite files and download
all of the libraries.

## Data

Our main data can be found in `bg_descriptions.csv` and `bg_descriptions_v2.csv`. This is data
that has been modified from this 
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews).

## Outside Resources

We did not use any resources not provided to us in this class, nor any specialized libraries.
